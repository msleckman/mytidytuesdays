### 1. Cleaning 

## a. Gender

```{r eval = FALSE}

gender <- tt$gender %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(gender = str_trim(county))

unique(gender$county)


```

## b. Households

```{r }

colnames(tt$households)

households <- tt$households %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(county = str_trim(county))

print(unique(households$average_household_size))

head(households)

```

## c. Crops

```{r }

skim(tt$crops)
print(unique(tt$crops$SubCounty))

crops <- tt$crops %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(sub_county = str_trim(sub_county))

```

### 2. First Exploration Plots
